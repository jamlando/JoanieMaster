```swift
class KeychainService {
    func store(key: String, value: String) throws
    func retrieve(key: String) throws -> String?
    func delete(key: String) throws
    func clearAll() throws
}
```

**Session Management Flow:**
1. App Launch → Check Keychain for stored tokens
2. Token Found → Validate with Supabase
3. Token Valid → Restore user session
4. Token Invalid → Refresh or redirect to login
5. Background → Monitor and refresh tokens

**Error Handling Strategy:**
- Network errors: Retry with exponential backoff
- Invalid tokens: Clear and redirect to login
- Keychain errors: Log and fallback to login
- Supabase errors: Handle gracefully with user feedback

### Dependencies and Integration Points

- Memory usage stable during session management

**User Experience Metrics:**
- No unexpected logouts
- Smooth transitions between states
- Clear error messages
- Minimal loading states

### Current Challenge Analysis

**Problem**: Authentication UI files exist in the file system but aren't included in the Xcode project:
- AuthenticationViewModel.swift (exists in ViewModels/)
- AppViewModel.swift (exists in ViewModels/)
- LoginView.swift (exists in Views/)
- RegisterView.swift (exists in Views/)
- ForgotPasswordView.swift (exists in Views/)

**Root Cause**: The Xcode project file (project.pbxproj) only includes the basic files created during initial project setup:
- JoanieApp.swift
- ContentView.swift
- Assets.xcassets
- Info.plist

**Impact**: These files won't compile because they're not part of the build target, causing build failures when the authentication features are implemented.

**Solution**: Add all missing Swift files to the Xcode project by updating the project.pbxproj file to include proper file references, build file entries, and group organization.
