# Joanie iOS App Development Plan

## Background and Motivation

Joanie is an iOS app designed to help parents digitally preserve and analyze their preschool and elementary-aged children's creative works (drawings, artwork, school assignments). The app emphasizes family engagement through AI-powered insights, storytelling, and progress tracking.

**Key Value Proposition**: Transform physical piles of children's artwork into an organized, educational digital experience with AI-powered tips, personalized stories, and progress visualization.

**Target Users**: Parents aged 25-45 with children aged 3-10
**Primary Goals**: 
- 10,000 downloads in first year
- 70% user retention after 30 days
- 4+ star App Store rating

**Current Status**: User has completed Apple Developer account signup and wants to utilize TestFlight for app testing. This is a critical milestone for moving from development to beta testing phase.

**PLANNER UPDATE (2025-01-10)**: User has requested to pause email service integration work due to email provider changes. New focus areas:
1. Implement Feature Toggle Service with notifications as first toggle
2. Focus development on core user flow: taking pictures of children's drawings and saving to profile

**PLANNER UPDATE (2025-01-10)**: Analysis of CoreFeatureRequestPRD.txt reveals alignment opportunities and key differences that need resolution.

## Feature Toggle Service Architecture Design

### Core Architecture Components

#### 1. FeatureToggle Protocol
```swift
protocol FeatureToggle {
    var key: String { get }
    var isEnabled: Bool { get }
    var scope: ToggleScope { get }
    var lastUpdated: Date { get }
    var metadata: [String: Any]? { get }
    var experimentId: String? { get } // Added for A/B testing
}

enum ToggleScope {
    case global
    case user(userId: String)
    case group(groupId: String)
    case device(deviceId: String)
}
```

#### 2. FeatureToggleService
- **Local Storage**: `UserDefaults` for simple toggles, `Core Data` with indexing for complex data
- **Remote Sync**: Supabase with `URLSession` background configuration and JWT authentication
- **Caching Strategy**: In-memory cache with 24-hour TTL, persisted to `UserDefaults`/`Core Data`
- **Conflict Resolution**: Last-write-wins with timestamp comparison, fallback to default states

#### 3. FeatureToggleManager
- **Centralized Access**: Single source of truth using `Combine` or `Swift Concurrency`
- **Performance Optimization**: Lazy loading, batch operations, max 1ms toggle checks
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation, user alerts for sync failures, Sentry logging
- **Observable Pattern**: `@Published` properties for SwiftUI updates

#### 4. Notification Toggle Implementation
- **Wrapper Service**: `NotificationWrapperService` checks toggle and system permissions
- **Permission Integration**: Respects `UNUserNotificationCenter` and app toggle
- **UI Integration**: Settings toggle with VoiceOver, Dynamic Type, and haptic feedback
- **Analytics**: Track toggle usage with Firebase Analytics

### Implementation Strategy

#### Phase 1: Foundation (Task 7.1.1)
1. Design FeatureToggle protocol with experimentId for A/B testing
2. Create FeatureToggleService with UserDefaults and Core Data (indexed)
3. Implement toggle scope system (global, user, group, device)
4. Design notification toggle as first implementation
5. Create FeatureToggleManager with Combine or Swift Concurrency
6. Set up secure storage (Keychain for user IDs, encrypted Core Data)
7. Document APIs with SwiftDoc and create developer guide

#### Phase 2: Notification Toggle (Task 7.1.2)
1. Create NotificationToggle model and service
2. Implement notification permission checking with UNUserNotificationCenter
3. Add toggle UI in settings with VoiceOver, Dynamic Type, and haptic feedback
4. Create NotificationWrapperService respecting toggle state
5. Update all notification calls to use wrapper service
6. Integrate Firebase Analytics for toggle usage tracking
7. Test notification on/off functionality (unit, UI, edge cases)

#### Phase 3: Integration (Task 7.1.3)
1. Update AuthService to respect notification toggle
2. Update EmailService to check toggle state
3. Update AI service notifications to use wrapper
4. Update progress tracking notifications
5. Add toggle checks to all push notification triggers
6. Implement Sentry logging for toggle errors
7. Test integration with 90% test coverage, including offline scenarios

### Future Extensibility

The architecture is designed to support:
- **User Targeting**: User-specific toggles via Supabase queries
- **Group Targeting**: Support for beta groups, geographic targeting
- **A/B Testing**: Experiment tracking with experimentId

### Technical Implementation Details

**Keychain Service Architecture:**
```swift
class KeychainService {
    func store(key: String, value: String) throws
    func retrieve(key: String) throws -> String?
    func delete(key: String) throws
    func clearAll() throws
}
```

**Session Management Flow:**
1. App Launch → Check Keychain for stored tokens
2. Token Found → Validate with Supabase
3. Token Valid → Restore user session
4. Token Invalid → Refresh or redirect to login
5. Background → Monitor and refresh tokens

**Error Handling Strategy:**
- Network errors: Retry with exponential backoff
- Invalid tokens: Clear and redirect to login
- Keychain errors: Log and fallback to login
- Supabase errors: Handle gracefully with user feedback

### Dependencies and Integration Points

- Keychain operations < 100ms
- Memory usage stable during session management

**User Experience Metrics:**
- No unexpected logouts
- Smooth transitions between states
- Clear error messages
- Minimal loading states

### Current Challenge Analysis

**Problem**: Authentication UI files exist in the file system but aren't included in the Xcode project:
- AuthenticationViewModel.swift (exists in ViewModels/)
- AppViewModel.swift (exists in ViewModels/)
- LoginView.swift (exists in Views/)
- RegisterView.swift (exists in Views/)
- ForgotPasswordView.swift (exists in Views/)

**Root Cause**: The Xcode project file (project.pbxproj) only includes the basic files created during initial project setup:
- JoanieApp.swift
- ContentView.swift
- Assets.xcassets
- Info.plist

**Impact**: These files won't compile because they're not part of the build target, causing build failures when the authentication features are implemented.

**Solution**: Add all missing Swift files to the Xcode project by updating the project.pbxproj file to include proper file references, build file entries, and group organization.
